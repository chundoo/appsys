The vast and bright ""open space"" living room, illuminated by large windows and bay windows, is composed of a modern kitchen facing the living room, which opens onto a private garden. Adjacent to the living space, a storeroom will make your life more pleasant.
Upstairs, a master bedroom with its dressing room, its bathroom en suite and two other bedrooms take their place with a common shower room to perfect this level. Outside, the terrace overlooking the green garden and the swimming pool integrated in the landscape is the ideal place to recharge your batteries. You will be lulled by the lapping of the river water.
Our 4 architect designed lofts with a surface area of 79 m² offer ingeniously designed and refined interiors. Trendy and decorative, they create a luminous whole thanks to large glass surfaces. They are declined into several spaces, including a living room, a kitchen and a storeroom on the first floor, as well as the master bedroom with adjoining bathroom. A second bedroom en suite is planned on the first floor. A well-dimensioned terrace also dominates the garden, with a breathtaking view of the river.

Its 30 meters high plant promontory, sloping gently towards a sea that reinvents the light of Tamarin Bay.
This geological exception of Mauritius gives to its residents the quiet assurance of living on a protective site and the intimate feeling of owning the ocean. The view is incredible. This is not the only offering of AKASHA... The various plans promontory naturally define the Corniche, the Terrasses, the Village... The names immediately install the setting for a scene that will see the intimacy of each blend in its small tropical Eden.
We will travel the 26 hectares of lush greenery on foot, by bike or golfcart. The use of polluting vehicles will be limited. Guaranteed a harmonious and sustainable development, the project will benefit from the services of the future Smart City of Cap Tamarin. AKASHA host only freehold villas; nature is queen and she will define their perimeters.
The architect took advantage of the topographical conditions offering the ocean and mountain view at the top, lagoon and river at the bottom. Magnifying the abolition of borders between inside and outside, he created the “Mauritian “living islets each with its own personality…
It then remains to choose the setting and lifestyle. Will you be Village or villa? You see life on two levels or just one? Anyway, let yourself be guided by your temperament and your desires… you’ll fall in love multiple ways of inhabiting AKASHA.","Land surface

Uniquely situated, it benefits from a generous outlook onto indigenous flora, a natural pond which was used in the past to cultivate fish and river prawns, the lush greenery of the river that opens onto Tamarin Bay, as well as a view from the bottom of the property onto the La Tourelle mountain.
The plot covers a surface of 1825.63 m2 with an extra 700 m2 of land for exclusive use. It holds many treasures such as a natural water source and a unique Tamarin tree, in which is believed to be referenced in the acclaimed book “Le Chercheur d’Or”, written by novelist Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio.
As for the Villa, every detail has been taken into account. The décor originates from South Africa, the furniture tailor-made, the carpentry in Pine, the pool deck in treated wood and the thatched roof with a 20-year durability.
Earthy hues merged with the natural textures of wood, stone and straw are found throughout the Villa, allowing to smoothly integrate into its natural surrounding.
One of the key features of this villa is the flow from one room to the other, enabling a sense of effortless movement in complete privacy and tranquility.
The living and dining room opens directly onto the 30 m2 pool and 100 m2 deck overlooking the glorious lush setting.
All 3 bedrooms are en-suite, of which the master bedroom has direct access onto the deck. A 4th room is currently being used as an office but can easily be used as an extra bedroom.
This is a remarkable property; a one-of-a-kind, making it an investment and lifestyle opportunity not to be missed.","Land surface

This plot orientation offers the best views of the sea and Le Morne mountain, as well as a softer luminosity. These villas will be kissed by the South-East trade winds, and will appeal to those who want to fully enjoy the savannah type nature of the site.
Their configuration includes movable vertical screens on the South facade to block out the prevailing winds and a more spacious inner courtyard, where the swimming pool has been placed. There are three en-suite bedrooms (with an optional fourth bedroom) and the large and warm living space combines an open-plan kitchen, a spacious living room and a dining room.
In Black River, the beauty of the lush landscapes is matched only by the charm of the lagoon. Nestled along a mountain range, bordered by the limpid waters of the Indian Ocean, this region owes its particular climate to its ideal location. Its abundant nature is a playground for sports enthusiasts: hiking trails and walks in the forest (the Black River Gorges National Park is part of the Macchabée - Bel Ombre biosphere reserve, recognized by Unesco in 1977 ); rounds of golf on one of the 4 18-hole courses in the region; outings by motorboat or catamaran, surfing, paddle boarding, water skiing, kite surfing and scuba diving... nature in Black River is a gift from heaven which offers activities for all tastes and in all seasons!
Particularly popular with families and expatriates from all over the world, Black River and its region offer a quality of life in its own right on the island. Its international schools of excellent standard (certified by the English and French education systems) and its services ranging from a private clinic to supermarkets and shops of all kinds make this coast a safe bet for all those who wish to combine the pleasures of island life to the needs and demands of everyday life: from work, to the crèche for the little ones!
The first phase includes 81 villas and residential plots in the heart of the estate, and will be accompanied by the construction of the clubhouse and the first 9 holes of the golf course. Phases 2 and 3 will follow with 78 and 61 units respectively. The 2nd phase will be accompanied by the construction of the last 9 holes of the course. Each phase is expected to be completed within three years of commencing commercialization. Three models of villas with an actual built surface of more than 400 m² are offered on land with an average surface area of ​​2,000 m². Based on the concept of sustainable architecture, each villa has a different orientation, with the lowest possible environmental impact by taking advantage in particular of the topology of the land, as well as natural ventilation and light. This unique project of exceptional scale in a very sought-after environment offers a breathtaking view of Le Morne and the Indian Ocean.
This concept is proposed for 24 villas (in phase 1). Elegant, spacious and intimate, they offer superb views of the sea, the golf course and the Tourelle de Tamarin mountain, while offering an ideal orientation, protected from the winds and fully benefiting from natural light. The patio with tropical landscaping is a green lung around which the life of the household revolves on a daily basis. With three en-suite bedrooms (a 4th bedroom is available as an option) and its large living spaces bringing together the living room, dining room and open kitchen, all facing the outdoor living spaces (kiosk and swimming pool), this is the home tropical family par excellence. Multicultural, heterogeneous, serene, exhilarating... The terms are as numerous as they are varied to describe the signature way of life of this coast of a thousand and one charms. And you, what will be yours? In the heart of the historic Black River Saltworks, facing one of the largest lagoons on the island, this program invites you to vibrate every day to the rhythm of a coast that makes no concessions and perfectly illustrates the pure dolce Mauritian life.
The site benefits from a unique savannah atmosphere. Its climate is very dry and its current landscapes are composed of a combination of tall Black River grasses, endemic trees, black wood trees, tamarind trees, Creole agaves and volcanic rocks. The landscaping concept aims to preserve the beauty of the site by reusing 100% of the site's existing plants for the roadsides, and by landscaping 90% of the environment around each villa with existing plants from the site and plants endemic to Mauritius","Land surface

The project aesthetic is a blend of beach and urban design. The architecture and interior design are inspired by nature. Neutral shades and natural textures reflect the environment, with accent colours and artworks creating focal points indoors. The atmosphere is simple, relaxed and comfortable.
Smart home facilities are optional. The living room, with its high ceilings and glass doors, is bright and offers enough space to entertain family and friends. The open-plan kitchen is equipped with all the elements of a classic Italian kitchen, with high quality finishes. Cool colours and natural shades extends throughout the home, bringing the lavish feel into the bedroom. In the bathroom, Terrazzo is used to line the walk-in shower to maintain its natural appearance and accentuate the dimension of a refined design. Here the luxury is in the detail.
This project includes a total of 33 apartments and penthouses spread over four buildings, some of which offer sea views. Among them, 11 apartments, with a total area from 94 to 127m², consist of a living room with open-plan kitchen, 2 bedrooms, 2 shower rooms, one of which is adjoining, and a terrace or balcony. All complemented by an underground parking space and visitors’ parkings.
In Mauritius, views are everything and the Roof Sky Lounge, the central element of the project, meets this expectation. It has been designed to promote wellbeing and invite relaxation. Residents can cool off in the infinity pool, relax around the BBQ and enjoy the wonderful sunsets available on the West Coast. The development also incorporates an outdoor rooftop gym with a lap pool. On the ground floor, a series of local shops complete the picture.
Rental management will be offered to owners wishing a return on investment.

Directly overlooking the splendid bay of Black River, on the west coast of Mauritius, here is a brand new project of high-end apartments offering a dream living environment: a sparkling ocean, easy anchoring in the bay for boat owners, a host of nearby attractions and unspoilt countryside and a
breathtaking view on Le Morne. A peaceful place filled with natural lighting, fresh air flowing in, and all the comforts needed to rest, relax, and rejuvenate.
The project has been carefully designed to combine contemporary style and ultra-modern fitting. While the residences are airy and open, the effect created is both supremely comfortable and delightfully cosy.
The architect uses sustainable and innovative concepts everywhere to maximise views, cross ventilation and natural lighting. His designs also feature natural elements like volcanic basalt stone and natural timber, crafted by skilled local artisans. The sense of cosiness and well-being is further enhanced by a neutral colour palette, with natural textures and layers of soft greys and whites, that create a simple, balanced and timeless effect.
The kitchen, smart and contemporary, has ultra-modern fittings from Italy (Aran Cucine). Home automation is available as an option.
This luxurious project includes a total of 31 residences, spread over small, low-rise (G+2) blocks,
including 6 penthouses, on 2 or 3 levels, with a total area of 161 to 252m² and composed of a living room with open plan or American kitchen, 2 to 4 bedrooms, adjoining shower rooms, a laundry area, balconies and roof terrace with private pool.
As well as the fabulous beachside setting, the environment is enriched by careful landscaping that incorporates local trees, such as blackwood, endemic palms and tecoma bushes.
The swimming pool’s generous length (25 metres) makes it suitable both for laps and for leisure swimming. A beach bar, near the swimming pool, allows you to enjoy the splendid sunsets offered by the west coast.
Rental management will be offered to owners wishing a return on investment.

The 3 bedroom penthouse has a large living space with a smart and contemporary kitchen has ultra-modern fittings from Italy, a dining room and a living room. It also features 3 en-suite bedrooms, which are a peaceful place filled with natural light, fresh air flowing in, and all the comforts needed to rest, relax, and rejuvenate.
The sense of cosiness and well-being is further enhanced by a neutral colour palette, with natural textures and layers of soft greys and whites, that create a simple, balanced and timeless effect.
The project has been carefully designed to combine contemporary style and ultra-modern fitting. While the residences are airy and open, the effect created is both supremely comfortable and delightfully cosy.
As well as the fabulous beachside setting, the environment is enriched by careful landscaping that incorporates local trees, such as bois noir, endemic palms and tecoma bushes. The swimming pool’s generous length (25 metres) makes it suitable both for laps and for leisure swimming. You can enjoy walking around barefoot, particularly enjoyable on the sand. The overall impact is of cosiness, comfort and freedom or, more contemporarily phrased, a form of boho-chic.

Sunset Cove’s architecture and interior design are modelled on nature. Neutral shades and natural textures reflect the environment, with accent colours and artworks creating focal points indoors.
LIVING ROOM
The living room echoes the natural character of the entrance, with high ceilings. Wide, low sofas overlook the landscaped gardens. Floor-to-ceiling glass windows, supported by sheer curtains, increase the flow of light and the feeling of space. The dining area provides enough space for family and friends.
KITCHEN
The open kitchen is the order of the day. This configuration ensures a feeling of light, space and
versatile design. It is equipped with all the elements of a classic Italian kitchen, with modular elements and high-quality finishes.
BEDROOM
Cool colours and natural shades are essential for a good night’s sleep. The colour palette extends throughout the home, bringing the lavish feel into the bedroom. Here the luxury is in the detail. The combination of minimalist style and statement pieces creates a perfect sanctuary in the
master bedroom.
BATHROOM
A warm palette of powdery tones with white accents reinforces the relaxing atmosphere. Terrazzo is used to line the walk-in shower to maintain its natural appearance and accentuate the dimension of a refined design.
TERRACE
Natural light enhances your mood by bringing more positivity and energy to your days. The apartments are designed to maximize these benefits. Residents can also experience these effects as they watch the day draw to a close and absorb the rays of the setting sun.
ROOF SKY LOUNGE
In Mauritius, views are everything and the Sunset Cove Roof Sky Lounge makes the most of them. Residents can relax around the BBQ and cool off in the infinity pool. Sunrise or sunset – what better place to greet the day?
Sunset Cove is just after Tamarin Beach, which is a great surf spot. The project aesthetic is a blend of beach and urban design, featuring a combination of organic neutrals and natural textures. The feel is simple, relaxed and comfortable.
Situated on the Coastal Road, the development comprises four blocks of two- and three-bedroom apartments. There are 33 apartments in total, some of which have a sea view and include a store room. Smart home facilities are optional. The Roof Sky Lounge is designed to promote wellbeing and invite relaxation with a BBQ area and infinity pool. The development also incorporates a rooftop outdoor gym with a lap pool. On the ground floor, lining the block flanked by the Coastal Road, is an array of convenience shops, including an organic & wellness shop and a coffee shop. More retail outlets are in walking distance, including the renowned bakery La Kaz A Pain. Further benefits include a convenient Clinic, offering key outpatient services which will be established in the vicinity.

Within minutes of the namesake public beach with its Martello Tower and age-old cannons, this versatile complex presents many opportunities for sophisticated and savvy buyers with high standards. With work commencing in July 2022 and delivery due in early 2024, the ground floor will consist of nine shops including a cosy coffee shop/restaurant/bar which will be the perfect spot to relax and socialise while having a leisurely lunch or afternoon snacks and drinks. Elegant offices will be situated on the first and second floors of the complex, which will be completed with a third floor featuring three exquisite and spacious penthouses, each with a private pool overlooking the crystal clear lagoon.
Designed and built by high-calibre and reputable professionals, it represents excellent value with a strategic location midway between Tamarin and Black River, close to all daily essentials such as shopping venues, filling stations, pharmacies, bakeries, and restaurants, schools and a sports centre.

Floor-to-ceiling windows bring the outside in and allow for plenty of natural light.
The spacious and beautifully appointed master bedroom incorporates a restful colour scheme and is sprinkled with subtle coastal accents to create an oasis of calm and comfort in each penthouse. Its large bay windows let in an abundance of natural light and outstanding sea views.
The penthouses have luxurious bathrooms featuring superior quality fixtures and fittings for a clean and contemporary finish. Subtle colours add a touch of understated style to these relaxing oases designed for pampering and relaxation.

The Ennéa residential cluster is a perfect example of what tropical island living is about. The focus on Indoor / Outdoor space, the private landscaped gardens, the use of local, natural materials, are an ode to Mauritian culture and traditions. Long, lazy lunches, hours basking in the sunshine, time spent with friends and family…
This is what Ennéa is about.
The townhouse / duplex is built on two levels, offering two perspectives. On the street side, there is an urban inspiration, with a strong emphasis on safe and welcoming neighborhood living. The garden side suggests a more traditional ambience that spills over into a private garden with a covered terrace, lawn, pool and shaded gazebo. The garden overlooks the golf course. The openness to this large green space allows natural light to filter in and air to circulate.","Land surface
